Here is a "Mad Lib" style set of tables if you need help coming up with a fun and engaging Timeline Twist. There are 3 Categories (Mundane Element + Impossible Modifier + Social/Physical Consequence) and you'll complete a total of 6 rolls (2 for each). 

# Usage
- For each category just roll a D6 to determine which table you'll pick from for that category, then roll again to determin the detail from that category.
- After you've completed your rolls for each category, put them together like this:
  - **Mundane Element** + **Impossible Modifier** + **Social/Physical Consequence**
  - Example Results:
    - A4-5 (Bacon Egg) + B2-1 (Defies gravity) + C4-6 (Emotions manifest as weather) =
      “Breakfast floats, and everyone’s mood controls the weather.”
    - A3-2 (Dentist) + B5-4 (Narrated by Morgan Freeman) + C2-1 (Has a holiday) =
      “Every day is a holiday for a specific Dentist, and they get to thave their entire day narrated by Morgan Freeman”
