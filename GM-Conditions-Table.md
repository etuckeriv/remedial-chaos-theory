## GM Reference: Conditions Table

When a Traveler fails a roll or the GM calls for a complication, roll **2d6**:  
- The first d6 chooses the **Category**.  
- The second d6 chooses the **Condition** within that category.  

Conditions should be temporary narrative quirks that are funny, inconvenient, or reality-bending; but never mean-spirited.  
They last until the Traveler succeeds on a later roll, the timeline shifts, or until the GM feels the scene has moved on.

1. **Perception Glitches**
   1. You see two copies of one other Traveler, both slightly out of sync.  
   2. Everything smells like toast, regardless of what it is.  
   3. You can’t tell colors apart; describe everything in grayscale.  
   4. You hear faint elevator music at all times.  
   5. Everyone’s voice sounds like your own.  
   6. You perceive yourself as a supporting character in someone else’s flashback.

2. **Physical Oddities**
   1. You become slightly magnetized; metal utensils and objects sort of.. follow you.  
   2. Your shadow kinda does it's own thing. Is it.. sentient?  
   3. You float one inch off the ground and can’t sit down.  
   4. Everything you touch hums softly, like a phone on vibrate.  
   5. You move in slow motion, but time passes normally.  
   6. Small items occasionally phase through your hands.

3. **Social Malfunctions**
   1. You always do the opposite of the social norm.  
   2. You can only communicate through song.  
   3. You loudly narrate your thoughts without realizing it.  
   4. You forget one Traveler’s name and keep calling them by a new one.  
   5. The second a non Traveler looks at you, they fall madly in love and pine for your attention.  
   6. You’re convinced everyone is lying to you about everything.

4. **Temporal Weirdness**
   1. You see traces of the other Travelers, but everyone else appears normal.  
   2. Déjà vu hits you often; you comment on it each time.  
   3. Your personal clock runs backwards—you think it’s getting earlier.  
   4. Everything you do has a three-second delay.  
   5. You see faint “loading” icons appear over objects before they move.  
   6. You’re certain the next thing you say will be prophetic (and maybe it is).

5. **Environmental Mutations**
   1. The floor becomes sticky wherever you walk.  
   2. Lights dim when you speak, brighten when you’re silent.  
   3. Any room you're in becomes uncomfortably humid.  
   4. Your reflection makes crude/vulgar gestures at you.  
   5. Gravity is slightly misaligned—everything leans toward you.  
   6. All nearby beverages start to fizz or boil.

6. **Existential Confusion**
   1. Your life suddenly flashes before your eyes and you contemplate why you're even doing all of this.  
   2. You remember an event none of the others recall.  
   3. Other Travelers appear to be horrifying cronenbergs.  
   4. You believe you are currently someone else’s Totem.  
   5. You are convinced your wife is missing and nobody seems to care.  
   6. You gain a sudden, unshakable fear that you’re fictional.

**GM Tip:**  
Encourage players to lean into conditions for laughs and storytelling.  
Award a Ripple Point if a Traveler plays a condition creatively or makes the table crack up.
