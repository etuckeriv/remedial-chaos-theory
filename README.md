# "Remedial Chaos Theory"

A Minimal TTRPG inspired by that episode of Community.

"Remedial Chaos Theory" is a humorous, competitive roleplaying game about a group of Travelers, each out of their own timeline, working desperately to shift reality back to their "Prime" timeline.

"Remedial Chaos Theory" uses six-sided dice, and pencil/paper for play.

## Travelers:
Each player is a "Traveler" who has the ability to traverse timelines, and are defined by a simple character sheet:
 - Who/what are they? This is intentionally vague :-)
 - A Totem: an ordinary object from their home timeline that acts as an anchorpoint. When successfully used in a novel or creative way, it can shift reality back to their home timeline and earn them "Prime Points". 
 - A "Timeline Twist": A twist on the base timeline that distinguishes it as their "Prime" timeline. The more absurd, the better! (HINT: Think Rick and Morty Interdimensional Cable style absurdity)

As the game unfolds, the Travelers are responsible for describing their actions and consequences, as well as tracking their "Ripple Points" and "Prime Points".
 - 4 "Ripple Points" = 1 "Prime Point"
 - 4 "Prime Points" wins the session.

Feel free to utilize "clocks" to track "Ripple Points" and "Prime Points" as well.

## The GM:
The GM has a simple role in this game: Provide the starting scenario ("base timeline") and guide the narrative as the game unfolds. Although the Travelers primarily build the world and tell the story, the GM has agency to throw in descriptions, "quirks", or "conditions" to liven up game play at their discretion.

## Playing:
The session begins with the GM describing the current scenario ("base timeline") , and then each Traveler writes down and announces a "twist" on the base timeline that signifies their "Prime" timeline. It could be that everyone is chairs, the food talks, or the air is fire and humans have evolved to breathe it somehow. The more absurd and chaotic, the better!

Throughout the session, each Traveler takes turns carrying out actions and using their totem in an effort to shift the timeline to their "Prime" timeline. Naturally timelines will shift often, and given the active timeline twist and current scenario it's up to the Travelers to think up ways they will shift the timeline to their own. Actions can result in either "Ripple Points" or "Prime Points" (or both!), as well as setbacks, and/or loss of points.

### The Action Loop
Each Traveler, in turn, takes an action in an attempt to shift reality to their timeline:
 - On the Traveler's turn they narrate the action that they're going to take
	 - GM Notes: Traveler actions should be both within the context of the active twist + current situation, and have some connection to their own timeline twist. If they use their Totem, usage should also fit logically into the the active twist + current situation
- Then they roll a D6:
	- 5-6 = Success. The Traveler narrates how they succeed and earns a "Ripple Point"
	- 3-4 = Setback. The other Travelers narrate the setback, no points earned
	- 1-2 = Failure. The Traveler narrates how they fail + the GM adds a random complication/condition
- Additionally, if they use their Totem during their action:
	- Critical Success (6) = They get a "Prime Point" (in addition to their "Ripple Point"), and everyone's reality shifts to their timeline
	- Success (5) = They get an additional "Ripple Point" and everyone's reality shifts to their timeline
	- Setback = They receive no points, but still manage to shift reality to their timeline (while still incurring the setback)
	- Failure = Lose 1 "Ripple Point" and the timeline jumps to the "base" timeline set by the GM (in addition to the random complication/condition set by the GM)
- If a Traveler starts their turn in their own timeline, they roll with advantage. Since they don't need to shift the timeline, they're instead working to "persist" their timeline. A successful roll means they strengthen their timeline's persistence and **the next Traveler rolls with disadvantage**.
	 - GM Notes:
		 - If you have more than one D6, they can roll 2 dice
			 - Take the highest for advantage
			 - Take the lowest for disadvantage
		 - If you only have 1 D6, just add a +1 to their roll for advantage or -1 for disadvantage

The session ends when one Traveler earns 4 "Prime Points", successfully shifting everyone's reality to their "Prime Timeline". The winning Traveler is the GM for the next session, using their "Prime Timeline" as the session's starting "base timeline".
