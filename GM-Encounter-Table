## GM Reference: Random Encounter Table

When transitioning to a new timeline, things slow down, or a Traveler’s failure opens the door for something new, roll **2d6**:
- The first die chooses the **Category**.
- The second die picks the **Encounter** within that category.

Encounters should *feel* immediate.. something enters, interrupts, or escalates the scene.
They are not combat; they are opportunities for chaos, comedy, and Traveler intervention.

1. **Visitors from Elsewhere**
  1. A delivery person bursts in, desperate to deliver a package labeled “Do Not Open Until You're "Home".”
  2. A group of alternate-version Traveler arrive, each insisting they’re the real one. All NPCs begin to freak out.
  3. A timeline tourist appears, taking selfies with everyone and demanding autographs.
  4. A poisonous, time-hopping gastropod is slowly following you across timelines. Don't let it catch you!
  5. A group of “Continuum Fixers” shows up to *repair* the current mess.
  6. A lost child asks which one of you is their parent, but no one remembers having a kid.

2. **Unnatural Phenomena**
  1. A glowing rift opens, belching out random objects from future and past. Nearby NPCs are horrified.
  2. Time has frozen and someone needs to figure out how to get it going again before the timeline can shift.
  3. Everyone’s shadows begin arguing among themselves, communicating through shadow-puppetry.
  4. A massive countdown timer appears, ticking loudly toward something undefined.
  5. The world suddenly has a soundtrack (choose: horror, disco, noir).
  6. All chairs/benches/stools/etc (sitting aparatus) briefly behave as if they’re alive and opinionated about having butts in their face.

3. **NPC Entanglements**
  1. A nearby NPC suddenly remembers being one of you in a "Past Life".
  2. An NPC demands the return of their favorite hoodie they lent you.. you’ve never met them.
  3. Someone recognizes the Travelers from a wanted poster showing them doing impossible crimes.
  4. The NPCs become aware of the game and begin voting on which Traveler’s timeline feels “most comfortable.”
  5. An NPC believes you're all up to no good and calls the local authorities.
  6. A nearby animal begins speaking and insists it’s the group's spirit-guide, but it’s never helpful. It travels with the group through the end of the game.

4. **Object Strangeness**
  1. Everyone's shirt (Travelers and NPCs) begins vibrating and kind of glitching between timelines.
  2. One random object becomes gravitationally significant—everything slides toward it.
  3. All of the gum underneath all of the tables begins slowly moving, making their ways towards the mouths of those who abandoned them.
  4. The group’s Totems begin humming in harmony, growing dangerously bright.
  5. A random object loudly proclaims it’s “the key to everything.”
  6. Someone’s forgotten lunch erupts from a nearby refirgerator, turning into a dimension-hopping organism. Maybe you'll encounter it again later?

5. **Reality Crossovers**
  1. The scene becomes a movie genre (choose randomly).
  2. A movie trailer voice starts narrating the next 30 seconds of play.
  3. A news broadcast begins describing your exact actions, live.
  4. Remnants of another Traveler's timeline begin quasi-appearing in this one.
  5. A portal opens to a parallel world where the Travelers are sitcom characters.
  6. A cosmic customer-service representative appears to file a complaint made by an NPC from the previous timeline.

6. **Emotional Collisions**
  1. All Travelers suddenly experience the same intense emotion (choose randomly).
  2. All NPCs suddenly experience the same intense emotion (choose randomly).
  3. Everyone in the room, Travelers and NPCs, get the unnerving feeling that they really need to leave.
  4. A nearby NPC begins uncontrollably confessing secrets to a Traveler.
  5. A Traveler receives a sincere apology from a nearby NPC.
  6. The group feels the overwhelming urge to perform a synchronized dance number.

**GM Tip:**
Encounters should never stall play—each should create a new *reason to act.*
If the table seems uncertain what to do next, ask:
> “Who’s taking responsibility for this?”
and hand control to the Traveler who speaks first.
